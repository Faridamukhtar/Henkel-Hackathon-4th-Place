Supreme\u202fLength is formulated to protect long strands and balance oily roots while keeping the length healthy. Because the hair also shows moderate\u2011to\u2011severe damage (dry/frizzy, dull, split ends), adding the **Ultimate Repair** mask supplies the strongest strengthening and rebuilding treatment that the Supreme\u202fLength line alone cannot provide (it has no mask).",
