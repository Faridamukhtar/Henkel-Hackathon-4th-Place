  "image_analysis": "Based on the photo, here's an analysis of the hair condition:\n\n*   **Dryness:** The hair does not appear dry. It has a soft, pliable look, and the light reflects evenly, indicating good moisture content. There's no straw-like texture or dullness often associated with dryness.\n*   **Shine:** The hair exhibits a high degree of shine. There are luminous reflections along the curves of the waves and across the top layers, suggesting smooth, healthy cuticles that reflect light well.\n*   **Frizz:** There is virtually no visible frizz. The hair strands lie smoothly together, creating a polished and sleek surface. Even along the part and the outer edges of the curls, frizz is absent.\n*   **Split Ends:** While a microscopic view would be needed for absolute certainty, the ends of the hair appear thick, full, and well-maintained. They hold their curl pattern beautifully without appearing wispy, thin, or ragged, which usually suggests minimal to no visible split ends.\n*   **Visible Damage:** There is no visible damage such as breakage, uneven texture, or excessive porosity. The hair color appears vibrant and consistent, without signs of chemical damage or heat styling stress. The overall impression is one of extremely healthy, well-cared-for hair.\n\nIn summary, the hair is in excellent condition, showcasing remarkable shine, smoothness, and fullness, with no visible signs of dryness, frizz, split ends, or other damage.",
